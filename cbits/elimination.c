// This file provides functions used by solumns/grid.rkt.
// Specifically, it provides fast elimation of squares with 3 neighbours of same colour.

// In Racket, #f is handled speedily.  In C, we don't have anything like it.
// Therefore, before passing any colours to this file, they should be incremented by 1,
// and #f should be converted to 0.  This file will return or write colours back in that same format.
